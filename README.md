Unofficial NiceHash app for checking your mining status and being notified of events

### Locked yet

While the application is freely and devoid of ads available
in [Play Store from this link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simmsoft.nicewatcher),
the source code is still locked.

By that I mean if you like the
application and something inside it has caught your
developer eyes and you
want to have it in your application, or just simply want
to support open source and the developers of it,
please consider donating
some bitcoin to the address below and when we reach the
milestone of 1.5 BTC, I will upload the entire source code
right here.

## Disclosure

- The source code will be made public under
a license
which enables you to pick any part of it and use it inside your
personal or commercial projects for free (currently looking for a proper license that does so).

- The money raised by your donations will be spent as funding for
a new project which unfortunately I can't yet share the details of.


- Reaching the milestone and uploading the source code does not
mean that the project will be abandoned. I will still actively
update and add new features to it.
